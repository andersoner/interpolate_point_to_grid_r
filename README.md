# interpolate_point_to_grid_r
Ingest irregularly-spaced rainfall (gauge) data for one day and interpolate them to regular degree grid spacing in R

This is an exercise in R that can be applied to any need to ingest .csv point data and interpolate it to a regularly-spaced R raster and .csv output. This particular case uses fake rain gauge data over El Salvador and interpolates it to a 0.1 degree grid.

Use the PowerPoint file for a general introduction to the R console and to perform the functions interactively. The data inputs needed for this exercise are provided in the "data_inputs" folder.

You can also download, modify, and run the sample .r script. Be sure to install the necessary packages listed at the top of the code, and modify local working directories as necessary.
